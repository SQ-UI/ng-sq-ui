        This module exports common interfaces, base classes, components and services utilized
        by other modules. Some examples include:
      </p>

      <ul class="list">
        <li>
          The <b>sqOutsideClickListener</b> directive is
          used to track if the user has clicked outside a specific element.
          It has been applied to the <a routerLink="/modal">sq-modal</a> component,
          as well as <a routerLink="/sq-ui">sq-dropdown</a> and <a routerLink="/sq-ui">sq-typeahead</a>.
        </li>
        <li>
          The <b>sqScrolledToBottomListener</b> directive is
          used to track if the user has scrolled to the bottom of a specified container.
          Emits an event only if the user has reached the bottom of the container.
        </li>
        <li>The <b>InputCoreComponent</b> class is
          used to make all of the <a routerLink="/sq-ui">FormElementsModule</a>
          components "bindable" to the internal Angular data-binding mechanisms and
          reactive form approach.
        </li>
        <li>
          The <b>sq-paginator</b> component is
          used to control the view collection of the
          <a routerLink="/datatable">sq-datatable</a> component.
        </li>
      </ul>
