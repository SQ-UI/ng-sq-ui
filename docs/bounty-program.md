# SQ-UI Bounty Program

We have decided to invest back our earned DEV protocol tokens into our community!
The SQ-UI project has been rewarded with 422 DEV tokens, thanks to your stakes!
We will be rewarding community members with DEV tokens for the following actions:

## Feature requests

> If you submit your feature request and
* is well documented
* has clear acceptance criteria
* is reviewed by the community
* gets pushed further to the next feature [release project](https://github.com/SQ-UI/ng-sq-ui/projects)

Reward for a feature request is up to 2 DEV tokens determined by quality / contribution. Multiple users can be rewarded for completing a single feature request.

## Merge Requests and Commits


> Create an MR that completes a well defined feature and:
* passes the build pipeline
* has tests covering the acceptance criteria
* gets approved and merged to release branch

Reward is up to 5 DEV tokens.

> Push a commit to a branch that fixes a known/documented or critical bug.

Reward is up to 2 DEV tokens.

## SQ-UI team preserves its rights to change reward program:

> You are not eligible to participate in this program if you have criminal background (including malicious OSS contributions on any platform)
> We might cancel or temporarily stop the bounty program if we run out of DEV tokens
> We can increase the bounty rewards if more people are staking DEV tokens to our project

Thank you for your support.
