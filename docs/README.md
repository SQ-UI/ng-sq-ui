# Introduction

## Another UI-kit? How is it different?

You've guessed right, folks - ng-sq-ui IS yet another UI-kit.
The intention behind it is to help Angular developers with their day-to-day work
by trying to offer a solution to the most widespread use-cases they have to handle. Without
being too opinionated on looks and without containing dozen of just "fancy" features. This,
with almost no additional dependencies. How cool is that?

## How do you determine the "most widespread" cases?

When we thought about what an initial version of the UI-kit should have,
we decided to simply ask other developers. We handed out a Google form
to different groups (Facebook groups and colleagues, included) and asked them what they mostly look for
when dealing with UI development. The most voted answer was "form elements",
and right after that - "modal dialogs". And these two types of components
are included in our first version of the kit.

We intend to keep the original idea of the UI-kit. We would like to ask the developers
what they need most for our next release! Don't hesitate to create a [feature request!](https://github.com/SQ-UI/ng-sq-ui/issues)

## Overview

You will find a description of the public API for each component. The components are grouped by modules.
Any properties you can see through code inspection that are left out from this documentation are for internal use and you should not rely on them.

Any types of public interfaces and services are also included here.
